# Microsoft-vs-Apple
The goal was to analyze and interpret survey data filled out by Hult Students. Using the unsupervised machine
learning algorithms our team had to interpret the results and develop marketing recommendations for Apple. 

Problem statement: What are the consumer buying behavior in regards to decision making between Apple and
Microsoft computers. Apple has decided to approach this question from the perspective of the Big 
Five personality traits as well as the Hult DNA. As such, our team has been
commissioned to run an analysis on these factors.
